                <h1>LOREM IPSUM</h1>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p>

                <h1>LOREM IPSUM</h1>
                <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <div class="pannel">
                <p>A Risk Assessment and a Vulnerability Assessment are both important components of an organization's security program. While a Vulnerability Assessment focuses on identifying and quantifying vulnerabilities in an organization's IT systems, applications, and networks, a Risk Assessment takes a broader view and considers the potential impact of those vulnerabilities on the organization's sensitive data, operations, and reputation. A Risk Assessment also considers non-technical factors, such as the organization's security policies and procedures, and helps the organization develop a comprehensive plan to mitigate potential risks.</p>
